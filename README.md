# Baby-bloom
Baby Blooms: AI Newborn Health Assistant
This project is a sophisticated, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) based chatbot designed to answer questions about newborn health. It leverages a powerful language model (via Groq) and draws information directly from a curated set of pediatric medical textbooks.

The application is built with Python and features an interactive web interface powered by Streamlit. It is designed to be an educational tool and includes a clear disclaimer that it is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

# ‚ú® Features
Interactive Chat Interface: A user-friendly web app built with Streamlit for a conversational experience.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Provides answers grounded in information from trusted pediatric medical textbooks, reducing hallucinations.

Advanced Reranking: Uses Cohere Rerank to improve the relevance of retrieved documents before generating an answer.

Intent Classification: Intelligently distinguishes between simple greetings, questions about the bot itself, and informational queries.

Conversational Memory: Remembers the context of the current conversation to provide follow-up answers.

# üöÄ How It Works
The project is built on the LangChain framework and follows a two-stage process:

Database Construction (build_database.py):

Loads multiple medical textbooks in PDF format.

Splits the documents into smaller, manageable chunks.

Uses Sentence-Transformers to create vector embeddings for each chunk.

Stores these embeddings in a FAISS vector database for efficient searching.

Web Application (appp.py):

When a user asks a question, the app first classifies the user's intent.

For informational queries, it retrieves the most relevant document chunks from the FAISS database.

A Cohere Rerank model refines the search results for maximum relevance.

The original question, chat history, and the retrieved context are passed to a Groq LLM, which generates a coherent, context-aware answer.

A disclaimer is appended to all medical-related answers.

# üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher

pip package manager

1. Clone the Repository
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
cd your-repository-name

2. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a file named .env in the root directory of the project and add your API keys:

GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key"
COHERE_API_KEY="your_cohere_api_key"

3. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

4. Install Dependencies
Install all the required Python libraries using the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Build the Vector Database
Before running the app for the first time, you must build the FAISS vector database. Make sure your PDF textbooks are available at the paths specified in the script.

python build_database.py

This will create a faiss_index folder in your project directory.

# ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Application
Once the setup is complete, you can start the Streamlit web application.

Run the appp.py file using Streamlit:

streamlit run appp.py

Your web browser will open a new tab with the chatbot interface.

üìÇ File Structure
appp.py: The main Python script for the Streamlit web application and RAG chain.

build_database.py: A script to process PDFs and create the FAISS vector database.

requirements.txt: A list of all Python dependencies.

.env: A file to store your API keys securely.

/faiss_index/: A directory containing the vector database (Generated by build_database.py).
